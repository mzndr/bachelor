# Virtual ITS-Lab
A docker-based application to provide virtual network environments for it-security education. 
Incorporates a CTF-like flag system to verify if students have completed their tasks.

Networks can be started from network presets, which are composed out of different docker containers. 
Files in the container can use a special syntax to insert generated CTF-like flags.

Users can be seperated into groups, and then be assigned to networks. Assigned users can use OpenVPN to connect 
to the virtual network.

This application is supposed to grand students the ability to do their it-security seminar from home, because of the current covid-19 pandemic.

"virtual-its-lab" is also part of my bachelor thesis.
